# pythoninchemistry Hackathon

Programming, software, apps, and coding are becoming a larger and larger component of the chemistry education. 
However, many educators of chemistry are not skill in the use or development of these tools. 
The [pythoninchemistry](https://pythoninchemistry.org) project is working to create programmatic examples and tools for educating chemical problems. 
These are Python code examples that can be used to aid in understanding and visualisation for all areas for the undergraduate chemistry curriculum; such as the [pylj](https://pythoninchemistry.org/pylj) software for introducing molecular dynamics simulation [1] and the steady state approximation numerical simulation [2]. 
However, in order to increase and improve the content available from this project, we need your help. 

The pythoninchemistry Hackathon is a free to attend event for those interested in chemical education using programming (no programming experience required) aimed at creating an educational content library that uses the Python programming language.
The aim of the hackathon is to bring together programming experts and those with an interest in chemical education, and to dedicate time to the development of tools that use Python and the Jupyter Notebook framework to allow students of chemistry to interact with practical examples, where the code is fully comprehensible. 

The hackathon will take place in January 2020 and we are looking for attendees with an interest in chemical education (again, no programming experience required) and for ideas of chemical concepts which may be attacked at the hackathon. 
More details will follow, please register your interest here for more information.
