# planning meeting
## 2019-06-20

### agenda 

- We are currently proposing a date in November 2019, probably should settle on a date (ideally not the first two weeks of November cause I am in Cambodia...)
- The event can be held at Bath, however, we need to liaise with Bath people regarding this. Previously Fiona Dickinson suggested that the Faculty of Science was happy to support with a room, etc.
- Need to have some level of direction of the content we want to develop. Previously we discussed starting a content library for chemical education, e.g. the subject matter could be really anything from chemistry.
- Does anyone have experience with the sort of shape a hackathon should take; in my head I envision some pre-event training (git, maybe basic python) for people to work on before hand, at the event the attendees would work on problems that interest them (we should have a list of problems to work on maybe) in groups, maybe with a group of "supervisors" to do a first pass code review (this would be beneficial for students of programming to work towards "best practice")...

### present 

- Ben Morgan (BJM)
- Natalie Fay (NF)
- Chris Adams (CA)
- Andrew McKinley (AM)
- Andrew McCluskey (ARM)

### apologies 

- Joao Malhado (JM)

### minutes

- ARM introduced the proposal
- BJM computing is not for comp chem alone, computational aspects in teaching are important
    - Bring programming into tutorials, coding is a more valuable exercise than force maths
    - pic was resources for the python undergraduate labs, short intro to programming 
    - Students expect chemistry to be test tubes, but really it is more about scientific analysis 
    - Computational resources for learning about chemistry not computing
    - Ben gave a lecture in 1st year kinetics 
    - Kinetic modelling in a jupyter notebook
    - Numerical vs analytical leading to the SSA
- RSC questions
    - ARM outlined questions
    - RSC outreach funds are a source of funding
    - Computing in chemistry, important
    - RSC schools 
    - Students in the future might expect computing 
    - Bath faculty might chip in some money
    - Swansea can provide from travel for 1 person 
    - Speak to James Grant (Bath) about funding
    - Bristol institute of learning and teaching, future funding 
    - M4 consortium corridor 
    - David willock, Andy Logsdial, David Nutt
- How many students? Organisation for hackathon
    - not too many people 
    - What is the design spec?
    - AM we need cases to apply our programming to
    - Fred Manby is working on electronic structure theory NTOSS (everything code, maybe relevant to teaching) 
    - Teaching computational lots of nice applications that are available with python
    - move the spartan lab to python 
    - Particle in a box (AM has stuff ready to go for that) 
    - Fred Manby happy to help if he can (particularly with NTOSS) 
    - Particle in a box two options: black box and students build the code themselves
    - educational value to equation to code link, even if it is slow 
    - Don't do boilerplate (git/python) in the hackathon, have prerequisites
    - Should everyone be coding (NF)? Don't exclude on code ability (BJM). Have people self-identify their ability (NF), make groups on that 
    - People that write the code would be able to learn what their code needs
    - NETWORK!!
    - Catalyse conversations; more unis 
    - NF will share Chloe's report after the marking is done
    - Chloe's material might 
    - need to have academics present over students to force long term involvement 
    - Ben would like a national set of resources, but lets start small and build up 
    - Write a brief to share (ARM first draft and share) and then try and get other unis involved (AM says do this after the hackathon) 
    - Quite short, and advertise the hackathon "teaching to code and codeing to teach"
    - Point to example (BJM to put kinetic lecture on pythoninchemistry, VICEPHEC workshop, ARM VICE talk) 
    - CA is interested for someone to advertise the hackathon at VICEPHEC19 (AM is keen) 
    - Does the hackathon have an upper limit? Maybe 30 (academics cover their own costs)?
    - Hard limit at 50 
    - VICEPHEC throws the net wide (get the excited people along)
    - Max group size of 5, subject expert and coding expert, others that like chemistry
    - Have people to advise problem, tweet to get problems to solve
    - Talk to Peter from Fred Manby's group will be put in touch with ARM 
    - Having ideas means we can get subject experts involved 
    - NF suggested that the br guys could come along but that might put non-coders along (AM & BJM) 
    - ARM should put a webpage to advertise the hackathon on python in chemistry webpage
- timings and location 
    - starting mid morning (10am at the earliest) before lunch is focused on planning then run until 4 or thereabouts. Before/after lunch sort presentation on what will you do, work on it till 3ish and present what you have done (electronic pinboards that everyone can access) and what need to happen (todo list to make this work) 
    - There is a pool for people to be our experts that we can pull from (NF, ARM, etc) 
    - FD said that getting a room should be easy
    - Weekend is bad for family's 
    - NF doesn't wanna steal, but bristol wouldnt charge for a room
    - BJM thinks that 0.01 would be suitable 
    - New date (Last week of January AM is the inter semester break) 
    - AM to ask FD about bath timings 
- any other business
    - thankses 
    - Could we end up like MICER in the future
    - Generate outputs to get sponsorship 
    - Microsoft might be interested, but small potatoes currently (BJM speak to James Grant) 
    - RSC local section might be interested in being involved NF (local section budgets are squeezed AM) 
    - SCI might be interested 
    - SSI and Christopher Woods might be interested 
    - Diamond/ISIS might be interest ARM might try and get people involved 
    - portfolio of existing materials should be prepared 
    - Notebooks for teaching maths
