# planning meeting
## 2019-06-20

### agenda 

- We are currently proposing a date in November 2019, probably should settle on a date (ideally not the first two weeks of November cause I am in Cambodia...)
- The event can be held at Bath, however, we need to liaise with Bath people regarding this. Previously Fiona Dickinson suggested that the Faculty of Science was happy to support with a room, etc.
- Need to have some level of direction of the content we want to develop. Previously we discussed starting a content library for chemical education, e.g. the subject matter could be really anything from chemistry.
- Does anyone have experience with the sort of shape a hackathon should take; in my head I envision some pre-event training (git, maybe basic python) for people to work on before hand, at the event the attendees would work on problems that interest them (we should have a list of problems to work on maybe) in groups, maybe with a group of "supervisors" to do a first pass code review (this would be beneficial for students of programming to work towards "best practice")...

### minutes

- Initially ARM and BJM introduced the proposal and the motivation behind it. 
    - This breaks down to, computing for chemistry is not computational chemistry; includes using programming for data analysis and as a tool to understand mathematical concepts. 
    - The aim of the proposal was to host a *hackathon* event at the University of Bath to begin to build up a library of content relevant to chemistry that using Python programming. 
    - An example of such content was developed by BJM and FD which is a Jupyter Notebook that may be used in the modelling of kinetics, showing how the steady state approximation is reached. 
    - This was presented in a first year undergraduate lecture at the University of Bath.
    - The pythoninchemistry webpages were also developed to allow for the advertisement of such materials, although there have not been a large amount of content developed. 
    - Any content that is developed *should* be content for learning chemistry **not** computing. 
    
- The proposal was funded by the RSC panel to the amount of Â£300, however the panel had some [questions](../questions.md). In particular, how would we continue to fund this endeavour was one that we didn't yet have an answer for.
    - AM and NF suggested that funding sources of funding would be RSC outreach and schools funding. These are particularly relevant as the idea of coding as a basic skill is becoming more common. 
    - For the current event, FD had previously mention that the Bath Science Faculty my have an interest in matching the RSC funding. 
    - AM said that Swansea would be able to cover travel for at least one attendee from Swansea. 
    - ARM suggested that James Grant (Bath Research Software Engineer with an interest in teaching) would possibly be able to facilitate connection with Microsoft. Although BJM worries we might be small fish for Microsoft. 
    - The Bristol Institute of Learning and Teaching should be a useful source of future funding. 
    - While in this conversation we also discussed the involvement; should we aim to form a M4 Consortium for teaching using Python? David Willock and Andy Logsdial from Cardiff may be interested (NF mentioned). AM suggested interest from David Nutt at Reading. 

- 



- How many students? Organisation for hackathon
    - not too many people 
    - What is the design spec?
    - AM we need cases to apply our programming to
    - Fred Manby is working on electronic structure theory NTOSS (everything code, maybe relevant to teaching) 
    - Teaching computational lots of nice applications that are available with python
    - move the spartan lab to python 
    - Particle in a box (AM has stuff ready to go for that) 
    - Fred Manby happy to help if he can (particularly with NTOSS) 
    - Particle in a box two options: black box and students build the code themselves
    - educational value to equation to code link, even if it is slow 
    - Don't do boilerplate (git/python) in the hackathon, have prerequisites
    - Should everyone be coding (NF)? Don't exclude on code ability (BJM). Have people self-identify their ability (NF), make groups on that 
    - People that write the code would be able to learn what their code needs
    - NETWORK!!
    - Catalyse conversations; more unis 
    - NF will share Chloe's report after the marking is done
    - Chloe's material might 
    - need to have academics present over students to force long term involvement 
    - Ben would like a national set of resources, but lets start small and build up 
    - Write a brief to share (ARM first draft and share) and then try and get other unis involved (AM says do this after the hackathon) 
    - Quite short, and advertise the hackathon "teaching to code and codeing to teach"
    - Point to example (BJM to put kinetic lecture on pythoninchemistry, VICEPHEC workshop, ARM VICE talk) 
    - CA is interested for someone to advertise the hackathon at VICEPHEC19 (AM is keen) 
    - Does the hackathon have an upper limit? Maybe 30 (academics cover their own costs)?
    - Hard limit at 50 
    - VICEPHEC throws the net wide (get the excited people along)
    - Max group size of 5, subject expert and coding expert, others that like chemistry
    - Have people to advise problem, tweet to get problems to solve
    - Talk to Peter from Fred Manby's group will be put in touch with ARM 
    - Having ideas means we can get subject experts involved 
    - NF suggested that the br guys could come along but that might put non-coders along (AM & BJM) 
    - ARM should put a webpage to advertise the hackathon on python in chemistry webpage
- timings and location 
    - starting mid morning (10am at the earliest) before lunch is focused on planning then run until 4 or thereabouts. Before/after lunch sort presentation on what will you do, work on it till 3ish and present what you have done (electronic pinboards that everyone can access) and what need to happen (todo list to make this work) 
    - There is a pool for people to be our experts that we can pull from (NF, ARM, etc) 
    - FD said that getting a room should be easy
    - Weekend is bad for family's 
    - NF doesn't wanna steal, but bristol wouldnt charge for a room
    - BJM thinks that 0.01 would be suitable 
    - New date (Last week of January AM is the inter semester break) 
    - AM to ask FD about bath timings 
- any other business
    - thankses 
    - Could we end up like MICER in the future
    - Generate outputs to get sponsorship 
    - Microsoft might be interested, but small potatoes currently (BJM speak to James Grant) 
    - RSC local section might be interested in being involved NF (local section budgets are squeezed AM) 
    - SCI might be interested 
    - SSI and Christopher Woods might be interested 
    - Diamond/ISIS might be interest ARM might try and get people involved 
    - portfolio of existing materials should be prepared 
    - Notebooks for teaching maths
