### notes

There is a plan to submit an application for the RSC Higher Education Group [Kickstart Funding for Effective Practice and Innovation in Chemistry Higher Education](https://rscheg.wordpress.com/2018/09/07/kickstart-funding/).
This is a fund of up to Â£300 to "support pilot chemistry education projects to be implemented by Higher Education Institutions in 2019".

Our application would involves the organisation and running of a 'hackathon' to take place in Bath, ideally in November 2019 time, either on a weekend or during a reading week.
The aim of the hackathon would be to develop some form of *chemistry coding resource*.
This resource would be the start of an chemical education content library to enable the embedding of Python into teaching, which would be shared under an open, permissive license for others to use.

The funding call had five bullet points that the project would need to be designed around:
- have an impact in at least 2 higher education institutions
    - We aim to leverage contacts at Bristol (Natalie Fey), Swansea (Andrew McKinley), and Imperial (Joao Malhado) to get students and acadmics involved in the hackathon
    - Any materials developed would be made available to all, however those universities directly involved in the development would be able to shape their construction
- provide opportunities not previously available to higher education students and / or teaching staff
    - The hackathon would be open to students (both UG and PG), with money assigned to cover student travel expenses
    - It would offer academics the time and space to focus fully on the development of the materials without distractions of the office
    - It is anticipated that the attendees would already have some familiarity with programming
    - Prior to the hackathon some prerequisite information (basic intros to Python and git) would be shared with the attendees with the expectation that they would work through this **before** attending
    - Opportunities of time for the development of programming educational content is not usually available
    - The experience of BJM and ARM as "expert" python programmers, and that of BJM, ARM, and FD as developers of open educational resources would be available to the attendees to better understand Python and how it may be used in education
- facilitate the implementation of effective and / or innovative chemistry education practice
    - This project would create a unique resource of educational content that would enable users to more easily bring programming, in Python into their teaching
    - Furthermore, we would share information about the design and implementation of the hackathon to enable others to grow the resources at their own hackathons
- deliver tangible outputs over a reasonably short timeframe e.g. 3 months
    - The nature of a hackathon is that it allows for a large amount of content (albeit not polished) to be created quickly
    - This content would then be polished (possibly by ARM as a component of his Diamond position) for deployment at the involved Universities in Semester 2 of the 2019/2020 academic year
- be scalable / extendable in the future (this may require funding applications elsewhere in due course)
    - Information about the design and implementation, including a "How to run your own Chemistry Hackathon" document will be made public to enable future growth the materials
    - This, along with the open, permissive licensing of the material, will create the situation such that the material may go organically in the style of a typical open-source project
